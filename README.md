# Introduction

Portobello Tech is an app innovator that has devised an intelligent way of predicting employee turnover within the company. It periodically evaluates employees' work details including the number of projects they worked upon, average monthly working hours, time spent in the company, promotions in the last 5 years, and salary level.

Data from prior evaluations show the employeeâ€™s satisfaction at the workplace. The data could be used to identify patterns in work style and their interest to continue to work in the company.

The HR Department owns the data and uses it to predict employee turnover. Employee turnover refers to the total number of workers who leave a company over a certain time period.

Conclusion

# The purpose of the analysis

The purpose of the project is to analyze and predict employee turnover within a company using machine learning techniques. The steps involved are as follows:

1. Perform data quality check.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand factors contributing to turnover.
3. Cluster employees who left based on satisfaction and evaluation.
4. Address class imbalance using the SMOTE technique.
5. Perform 5-fold cross-validation and train models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
6. Evaluate models using ROC/AUC scores, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.
7. Determine the appropriate evaluation metric (recall or precision) based on the confusion matrix.
8. Provide retention strategies for targeted employees.

The goal is to identify the best model for predicting turnover and offer insights to retain valuable employees.
